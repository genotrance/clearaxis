1.02
----
- Fixed a bug where Clearaxis was exiting after spawning Araxis Merge instead of
  sticking around. This was causing ClearCase to delete temporary files required
  by Araxis for the diff. (Fixed by Stuart Goldberg)
- Fixed a bug where Clearaxis was unable to find the Araxis install path for 
  version 6.0.
- Fixed a bug where Clearaxis was not adding XML support for ClearCase 7.

1.01
----
- Fixed bug where file paths with spaces were not being sent to Araxis Merge correctly.
- Library and DLLs are now being bundled into clearaxis.exe and compressed.
